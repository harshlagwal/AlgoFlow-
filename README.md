## 🧐 What is AlgoFlow?

**AlgoFlow** is a powerful educational tool designed specifically for CS students and beginners. It transforms your static code into **animated flowcharts**, making it easy to understand the logic behind loops, conditions, and complex execution flows.

Instead of just reading code, you can **watch it alive**. AlgoFlow provides step-by-step visualizations and teacher-style explanations, helping you bridge the gap between syntax and logic.

## ✨ Key Features in Detail

*   🎨 **Real-Time Visualization**: Just select your code and right-click. AlgoFlow creates a clean, SVG-based flowchart that accurately represents your logic branches and loops.
*   �️ **Interactive Control Center**: 
    *   **Play/Pause**: Run the entire algorithm animation automatically.
    *   **Step Discovery**: Go line-by-line to see exactly which variable changes when.
    *   **Speed Control**: Switch between Slow (for deep learning) and Fast (for quick overviews).
*   � **Loop Intelligence**: Visualizes loop-backs with animated arrows and iteration counters. No more guessing how many times your code repeats!
*   � **Embedded Teacher Persona**: A cartoon avatar explains the "Why" behind every step, helping you understand concepts like recursion and conditional branching in plain English.
*   💾 **Export & Share**: Download any flowchart as a high-quality SVG file. Perfect for college assignments, technical blogs, or study notes.
*   📊 **Complexity Intelligence Engine**: Built-in Big-O analysis for both Time and Space. It identifies loops, nested structures, and recursion patterns to help you write more efficient code.

## 🚀 How to Use

1.  **Select** a code block (Function, Loop, or Class) in your editor.
2.  **Right-click** and select `AlgoFlow: Visualize Code Selection`.
3.  Click the **Play** or **Step** button in the sidebar.
4.  Observe the **flowchart** and follow the **avatar's explanations**.
5.  Check the **Complexity Sticky Note** for a deep dive into efficiency.
6.  **Download** the SVG if you want to save the visualization.

## 🛠️ Supported Languages

*   🐍 **Python** (range, lists, recursion)
*   📜 **JavaScript** (arrays, push/pop, loops)
*   ⌨️ **C / C++** (pointers, vectors, standard I/O)

---

## 🧠 Complexity Engine

AlgoFlow features a **Student-Aware Complexity Engine**. Unlike raw compilers, it analyzes the entire block context to provide accurate Big-O notation ($O(n)$, $O(n^2)$, $O(\log n)$, etc.) that matches how you are taught in class. It intelligently handles fixed-range loops as educational examples, ensuring you get the "Why" behind the math.

## 🎓 Who is this for?

*   **Students** tackling Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).
*   **Beginners** who find loops or recursion confusing.
*   **Teachers** looking for a visual aid to explain logic in class.
*   **Visual Learners** who prefer diagrams over plain text.
