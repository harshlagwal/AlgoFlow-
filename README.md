## 🧐 What is AlgoFlow?

**AlgoFlow** is a powerful educational tool designed specifically for CS students and beginners. It transforms your static code into **animated flowcharts**, making it easy to understand the logic behind loops, conditions, and complex execution flows.

Instead of just reading code, you can **watch it alive**. AlgoFlow provides step-by-step visualizations and teacher-style explanations, helping you bridge the gap between syntax and logic.

## ✨ Key Features

*   🎯 **Code → Flowchart**: Instantly convert code snippets into professional flowcharts.
*   ▶️ **Execution Control**: Play, Pause, Step-through, or Restart your logic at any time.
*   🔁 **Loop Animations**: See exactly how loops repeat and where they exit.
*   🔵 **Dynamic Flow**: Animated arrows indicate the current direction of execution (forward and loop-back).
*   🧠 **Student-Friendly Explanations**: A virtual guide explains what each line does in simple English.
*   📊 **Complexity Intelligence**: Block-level Time and Space complexity analysis.
*   🧾 **Complexity Sticky Notes**: View detailed analysis by clicking nodes or the complexity icon.
*   ⬇️ **Export as SVG**: Download your flowcharts for inclusion in notes or assignments.
*   ⚡ **Adaptive Speed**: Choose from Slow, Normal, or Fast execution speeds to match your learning pace.
*   🌓 **Modern UI**: A clean, distraction-free interface built for focus.

## 🛠️ Supported Languages

*   🐍 **Python** (range, lists, recursion)
*   📜 **JavaScript** (arrays, push/pop, loops)
*   ⌨️ **C / C++** (pointers, vectors, standard I/O)

## 🧠 Complexity Engine

AlgoFlow features a **Student-Aware Complexity Engine**. Unlike raw compilers, it analyzes the entire block context to provide accurate Big-O notation ($O(n)$, $O(n^2)$, $O(\log n)$, etc.) that matches how you are taught in class. It intelligently handles fixed-range loops as educational examples, ensuring you get the "Why" behind the math.

## 🎓 Who is this for?

*   **Students** tackling Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).
*   **Beginners** who find loops or recursion confusing.
*   **Teachers** looking for a visual aid to explain logic in class.
*   **Visual Learners** who prefer diagrams over plain text.
