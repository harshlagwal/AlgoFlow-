## 🚀 Visualize Your Logic, Master Your Algorithms

**AlgoFlow** is an open-source VS Code extension built for **students, beginners, and B.Tech freshers** who want to stop "guessing" how their code works and start *seeing* it.

Whether you're struggling with nested loops, recursion, or just want to understand the flow of a new script, AlgoFlow transforms your static code into **dynamic, step-by-step flowcharts** and provides a **Complexity Intelligence Engine** to help you write professional-grade code from day one.
