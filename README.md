# AlgoFlow
### Visual Algorithms Made Simple

**AlgoFlow** is a powerful educational tool designed to help students and beginners master algorithms by seeing them in action. We transform complex logic into clear, animated flowcharts that bridge the gap between abstract code and visual understanding.

Turn code into visual flowcharts directly inside VS Code.  
Perfect for students, debugging, and learning algorithms visually.

## 🚀 Quick Start
1. Select any code in your editor  
2. Right-click → AlgoFlow: Visualize Code Selection  
3. Watch your logic turn into a step-by-step flowchart

## ✨ Features

- **Visualize Algorithms**: Instantly convert code selections into interactive, animated flowcharts.
- **Step-by-Step Execution**: Trace your logic line-by-line to see exactly how variables change and control flows.
- **Loop Visualization**: Intuitively understand repetition with animated back-edges and iteration tracking.
- **Complexity Analysis**: Built-in intelligence to identify Big-O notation (O(1), O(n), O(n²), etc.) for Time and Space.
- **Broad Language Support**: Works seamlessly with **Python, Java, C, C++, JavaScript, TypeScript, and R**.
- **Beginner-Friendly**: Includes plain-English explanations and a "Teacher Persona" to guide you through complex logic.
